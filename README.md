## Parts list
- 1  DB-25 male (solder cup)
- 1  Voltage regulator 2.85V (LD1117DT28TR)
- 18 Resistors 110R 0805
- 1  Resistor 680R 0805 (optional)
- 1  LED 0805 (optional)
- 3  Capacitors 10uF 0805

## Building and installation notes
Soldering should be straightforward for the SMD components and the DB-25 connector. Please don't forget the resistors on the underside of the PCB.

The PCB was designed with typical DB-25 shells in mind to be used as enclosure. Nevertheless, a custom case design for 3D printing is part of the repository. Just print the design twice and fasten it using M2.5 x 10 cylindrical screws and matching nuts.
